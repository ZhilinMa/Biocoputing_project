# Biocomputing_project
Joe and I worked to make a code that delivered us with a tabular output of the proteomes that contained McrA and variable hsp70 genes
In the process, due to working remotely from one another, we decided to use very strict file paths so our code would run independently.
Unfortunately, as a byproduct of this, our code is not orthogonal.
Please do not attempt to run Project_details.sh, but rather look through the code to see that we understood the prompt.
Our respective absolute file_paths were different, and may be different than yours.
We wanted to detail an independent way to utilize this to our advantage, even if it did mean typing more.
Thank you for your understanding, we will see you soon!
